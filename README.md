# conIntProject
I'm taking a stats class, and we were assigned a project where we had to gather some data, determine which proportion of the data fulfilled some criterion, and construct a confidence interval for that propotion. I looked at a PDF file of historical death certificates and determined what proportion of people died before their 20th birthday. As an exercise for myself, I'm trying to write a Python program that will automate this task, from reading in the PDF file to figuring out what proportion of my sample meets my criteria to computing the confidence interval.
